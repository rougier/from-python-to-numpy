Introduction
------------

Problem vectorization is much harder than code vectorization because it means
that you fundamentally have to rethink your problem in order to make it
vectorizable. Most of the time this means you have to use a different algorithm
to solve your problem or even worse... to invent a new one. The difficulty is thus
to think out-of-the-box.

To illustrate this, let's consider a simple problem where given two vectors `X` and
`Y`, we want to compute the sum of `X[i]*Y[j]` for all pairs of indices `i`,
`j`. One simple and obvious solution is to write:

.. code:: python

   def compute_python(X, Y):
       result = 0
       for i in range(len(X)):
           for j in range(len(Y)):
               result += X[i] * Y[j]
       return result

However, this first and naÃ¯ve implementation requires two loops and we already
know it will be slow:

.. code:: python

   >>> X = np.arange(1000)
   >>> timeit("compute_python(X,X)")
   1 loops, best of 3: 0.274481 sec per loop

How to vectorize the problem then? If you remember your linear algebra course,
you may have identified the expression `X[i] * Y[j]` to be very similar to a
matrix product expression. So maybe we could benefit from some NumPy
speedup. One wrong solution would be to write:

.. code:: python

   def compute_numpy_wrong(X, Y):
       return (X*Y).sum()

This is wrong because the `X*Y` expression will actually compute a new vector
`Z` such that `Z[i] = X[i] * Y[i]` and this is not what we want. Instead, we
can exploit NumPy broadcasting by first reshaping the two vectors and then
multiply them:

.. code:: python

   def compute_numpy(X, Y):
       Z = X.reshape(len(X),1) * Y.reshape(1,len(Y))
       return Z.sum()

Here we have `Z[i,j] == X[i,0]*Y[0,j]` and if we take the sum over each elements of
`Z`, we get the expected result. Let's see how much speedup we gain in the
process:

.. code:: python

   >>> X = np.arange(1000)
   >>> timeit("compute_numpy(X,X)")
   10 loops, best of 3: 0.00157926 sec per loop

This is better, we gained a factor of ~150. But we can do much better.

If you look again and more closely at the pure Python version, you can see that
the inner loop is using `X[i]` that does not depend on the `j` index, meaning
it can be removed from the inner loop. Code can be rewritten as:

.. code:: python

   def compute_numpy_better_1(X, Y):
       result = 0
       for i in range(len(X)):
           Ysum = 0
           for j in range(len(Y)):
               Ysum += Y[j]
           result += X[i]*Ysum
       return result

But since the inner loop does not depend on the `i` index, we might as well
compute it only once:

.. code:: python

   def compute_numpy_better_2(X, Y):
       result = 0
       Ysum = 0
       for j in range(len(Y)):
           Ysum += Y[j]
       for i in range(len(X)):
           result += X[i]*Ysum
       return result

Not so bad, we have removed the inner loop, transforming :math:`O(n^2)` 
complexity into :math:`O(n)` complexity. Using the same approach, we can now 
write:

.. code:: python

   def compute_numpy_better_3(x, y):
       Ysum = 0
       for j in range(len(Y)):
           Ysum += Y[j]
       Xsum = 0
       for i in range(len(X)):
           Xsum += X[i]
       return Xsum*Ysum

Finally, having realized we only need the product of the sum over `X` and `Y`
respectively, we can benefit from the `np.sum` function and write:

.. code:: python

   def compute_numpy_better(x, y):
       return np.sum(y) * np.sum(x)

It is shorter, clearer and much, much faster:

.. code:: python

   >>> X = np.arange(1000)
   >>> timeit("compute_numpy_better(X,X)")
   1000 loops, best of 3: 3.97208e-06 sec per loop

We have indeed reformulated our problem, taking advantage of the fact that
:math:`\sum_{ij}{X_i}{Y_j} = \sum_{i}X_i \sum_{j}Y_j$` and we've learned in the
meantime that there are two kinds of vectorization: code vectorization and
problem vectorization. The latter is the most difficult but the most
important because this is where you can expect huge gains in speed. In this
simple example, we gain a factor of 150 with code vectorization but we gained a
factor of 70,000 with problem vectorization, just by writing our problem
differently (even though you cannot expect such a huge speedup in all
situations). However, code vectorization remains an important factor, and if we
rewrite the last solution the Python way, the improvement is good but not as much as
in the NumPy version:

.. code:: python

   def compute_python_better(x, y):
       return sum(x)*sum(y)

This new Python version is much faster than the previous Python version, but
still, it is 50 times slower than the NumPy version:

.. code:: python

   >>> X = np.arange(1000)
   >>> timeit("compute_python_better(X,X)")
   1000 loops, best of 3: 0.000155677 sec per loop




Path finding
------------

Path finding is all about finding the shortest path in a graph. This can be
split in two distinct problems: to find a path between two nodes in a graph and
to find the shortest path. We'll illustrate this through path finding in a
maze. The first task is thus to build a maze.

Building a maze
+++++++++++++++

There exist `many maze generation algorithms
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm>`_ but I tend to
prefer the one I've been using for several years but whose origin is unknown to
me. I've added the code in the cited wikipedia entry. Feel free to complete it
if you know the original author. This algorithm works by creating `n` (density)
islands of length `p` (complexity). An island is created by choosing a random
starting point with odd coordinates, then a random direction is chosen. If the
cell two steps in a given direction is free, then a wall is added at both one step
and two steps in this direction. The process is iterated for `n` steps for this
island. `p` islands are created. `n` and `p` are expressed as `float` to adapt them to
the size of the maze. With a low complexity, islands are very small and the
maze is easy to solve. With low density, the maze has more "big empty rooms".

.. code:: python

   def build_maze(shape=(65, 65), complexity=0.75, density=0.50):
       # Only odd shapes
       shape = ((shape[0]//2)*2+1, (shape[1]//2)*2+1)

       # Adjust complexity and density relatively to maze size
       n_complexity = int(complexity*(shape[0]+shape[1]))
       n_density = int(density*(shape[0]*shape[1]))

       # Build actual maze
       Z = np.zeros(shape, dtype=bool)

       # Fill borders
       Z[0, :] = Z[-1, :] = Z[:, 0] = Z[:, -1] = 1

       # Islands starting point with a bias in favor of border
       P = np.random.normal(0, 0.5, (n_density, 2))
       P = 0.5 - np.maximum(-0.5, np.minimum(P, +0.5))
       P = (P*[shape[1], shape[0]]).astype(int)
       P = 2*(P//2)

       # Create islands
       for i in range(n_density):
           # Test for early stop: if all starting point are busy, this means we
           # won't be able to connect any island, so we stop.
           T = Z[2:-2:2, 2:-2:2]
           if T.sum() == T.size: break
           x, y = P[i]
           Z[y, x] = 1
           for j in range(n_complexity):
               neighbours = []
               if x > 1:          neighbours.append([(y, x-1), (y, x-2)])
               if x < shape[1]-2: neighbours.append([(y, x+1), (y, x+2)])
               if y > 1:          neighbours.append([(y-1, x), (y-2, x)])
               if y < shape[0]-2: neighbours.append([(y+1, x), (y+2, x)])
               if len(neighbours):
                   choice = np.random.randint(len(neighbours))
                   next_1, next_2 = neighbours[choice]
                   if Z[next_2] == 0:
                       Z[next_1] = 1
                       Z[next_2] = 1
                       y, x = next_2
               else:
                   break
       return Z

Here is an animation showing the generation process.

Breadth-first
+++++++++++++

The breadth-first (as well as depth-first) search algorithm addresses the problem
of finding a path between two nodes by examining all possibilities starting
from the root node and stopping as soon as a solution has been found
(destination node has been reached). This algorithm runs in linear time with
complexity in :math:`O(|V|+|E|)` (where :math:`V` is the number of vertices, and :math:`E` is
the number of edges). Writing such an algorithm is not especially difficult,
provided you have the right data structure. In our case, the array
representation of the maze is not the most well-suited and we need to transform
it into an actual graph as proposed by `Valentin Bryukhanov
<http://bryukh.com>`_.

.. code:: python

   def build_graph(maze):
       height, width = maze.shape
       graph = {(i, j): [] for j in range(width)
                           for i in range(height) if not maze[i][j]}
       for row, col in graph.keys():
           if row < height - 1 and not maze[row + 1][col]:
               graph[(row, col)].append(("S", (row + 1, col)))
               graph[(row + 1, col)].append(("N", (row, col)))
           if col < width - 1 and not maze[row][col + 1]:
               graph[(row, col)].append(("E", (row, col + 1)))
               graph[(row, col + 1)].append(("W", (row, col)))
       return graph


.. note::

   If we had used the depth-first algorithm, there is no guarantee to find the
   shortest path, only to find a path (if it exists).

Once this is done, writing the breadth-first algorithm is
straightforward. We start from the starting node and we visit nodes at
the current depth only (breadth-first, remember?) and we iterate the
process until reaching the final node, if possible. The question is
then: do we get the shortest path exploring the graph this way? In
this specific case, "yes", because we don't have an edge-weighted graph,
i.e. all the edges have the same weight (or cost).

.. code:: python

   def breadth_first(maze, start, goal):
       queue = deque([([start], start)])
       visited = set()
       graph = build_graph(maze)

       while queue:
           path, current = queue.popleft()
           if current == goal:
               return np.array(path)
           if current in visited:
               continue
           visited.add(current)
           for direction, neighbour in graph[current]:
               p = list(path)
               p.append(neighbour)
               queue.append((p, neighbour))
       return None


Bellman-Ford method
+++++++++++++++++++

The BellmanâFord algorithm is an algorithm that is able to find the optimal
path in a graph using a diffusion process. The optimal path is found by ascending
the resulting gradient. This algorithm runs in quadratic time :math:`O(|V||E|)`
(where :math:`V` is the number of vertices, and :math:`E` is the number of edges). However, in
our simple case, we won't hit the worst case scenario. The algorithm is
illustrated below (reading from left to right, top to bottom). Once this is
done, we can ascend the gradient from the starting node. You can check on the
figure that this leads to the shortest path.

   it is easy to find the shortest path by ascending the value gradient.

   :width: 19%

We start by setting the exit node to the value 1, while every other node is
set to 0, except the walls. Then we iterate a process such that each
cell's new value is computed as the maximum value between the current cell value
and the discounted (`gamma=0.9` in the case below) 4 neighbour values. The
process starts as soon as the starting node value becomes strictly positive.

The NumPy implementation is straightforward if we take advantage of the
`generic_filter` (from `scipy.ndimage`) for the diffusion process:

.. code:: python

   def diffuse(Z):
       # North, West, Center, East, South
       return max(gamma*Z[0], gamma*Z[1], Z[2], gamma*Z[3], gamma*Z[4])

   # Build gradient array
   G = np.zeros(Z.shape)

   # Initialize gradient at the entrance with value 1
   G[start] = 1

   # Discount factor
   gamma = 0.99

   # We iterate until value at exit is > 0. This requires the maze
   # to have a solution or it will be stuck in the loop.
   while G[goal] == 0.0:
       G = Z * generic_filter(G, diffuse, footprint=[[0, 1, 0],
                                                     [1, 1, 1],
                                                     [0, 1, 0]])

But in this specific case, it is rather slow. We'd better cook-up our own
solution, reusing part of the game of life code:

.. code:: python

   # Build gradient array
   G = np.zeros(Z.shape)

   # Initialize gradient at the entrance with value 1
   G[start] = 1

   # Discount factor
   gamma = 0.99

   # We iterate until value at exit is > 0. This requires the maze
   # to have a solution or it will be stuck in the loop.
   G_gamma = np.empty_like(G)
   while G[goal] == 0.0:
       np.multiply(G, gamma, out=G_gamma)
       N = G_gamma[0:-2,1:-1]
       W = G_gamma[1:-1,0:-2]
       C = G[1:-1,1:-1]
       E = G_gamma[1:-1,2:]
       S = G_gamma[2:,1:-1]
       G[1:-1,1:-1] = Z[1:-1,1:-1]*np.maximum(N,np.maximum(W,
                                   np.maximum(C,np.maximum(E,S))))

Once this is done, we can ascend the gradient to find the shortest path as
illustrated on the figure below:

Lagrangian vs Eulerian method
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note::

   Excerpt from the Wikipedia entry on the
   `Lagrangian and Eulerian specification <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_and_Eulerian_specification_of_the_flow_field>`_

In classical field theory, the Lagrangian specification of the field is a way of
looking at fluid motion where the observer follows an individual fluid parcel
as it moves through space and time. Plotting the position of an individual
parcel through time gives the pathline of the parcel. This can be visualized as
sitting in a boat and drifting down a river.

The Eulerian specification of the flow field is a way of looking at fluid
motion that focuses on specific locations in the space through which the fluid
flows as time passes. This can be visualized by sitting on the bank of a river
and watching the water pass the fixed location.

In other words, in the Eulerian case, you divide a portion of space into cells
and each cell contains a velocity vector and other information, such as density
and temperature. In the Lagrangian case, we need particle-based physics with
dynamic interactions and generally we need a high number of particles. Both
methods have advantages and disadvantages and the choice between the two
methods depends on the nature of your problem. Of course, you can also mix the
two methods into a hybrid method.

However, the biggest problem for particle-based simulation is that particle
interaction requires finding neighbouring particles and this has a cost as
we've seen in the boids case. If we target Python and NumPy only, it is probably
better to choose the Eulerian method since vectorization will be almost trivial
compared to the Lagrangian method.


NumPy implementation
++++++++++++++++++++

I won't explain all the theory behind computational fluid dynamics because
first, I cannot (I'm not an expert at all in this domain) and there are many
resources online that explain this nicely (have a look at references below,
especially tutorial by L. Barba). Why choose a computational fluid as an example
then? Because results are (almost) always beautiful and fascinating. I couldn't
resist (look at the movie below).

We'll further simplify the problem by implementing a method from computer
graphics where the goal is not correctness but convincing behavior. Jos Stam
wrote a very nice article for SIGGRAPH 1999 describing a technique to have
stable fluids over time (i.e. whose solution in the long term does not
diverge). `Alberto Santini <https://github.com/albertosantini/python-fluid>`_
wrote a Python replication a long time ago (using numarray!) such that I only
had to adapt it to modern NumPy and accelerate it a bit using modern NumPy
tricks.

I won't comment the code since it would be too long, but you can read the
original paper as well as the explanation by `Philip Rideout
<http://prideout.net/blog/?p=58>`_ on his blog. Below are some movies I've made
using this technique.

Blue noise sampling
-------------------

Blue noise refers to sample sets that have random and yet uniform distributions
with absence of any spectral bias. Such noise is very useful in a variety of
graphics applications like rendering, dithering, stippling, etc. Many different
methods have been proposed to achieve such noise, but the most simple is certainly
the DART method.

   resampled using voronoi cells whose centers are a blue noise sample.

DART method
+++++++++++

The DART method is one of the earliest and simplest methods. It works by
sequentially drawing uniform random points and only accepting those that lie at a
minimum distance from every previous accepted sample. This sequential method is
therefore extremely slow because each new candidate needs to be tested against
previous accepted candidates. The more points you accept, the slower the
method is. Let's consider the unit surface and a minimum radius `r` to be enforced
between each point.

Knowing that the densest packing of circles in the plane is the hexagonal
lattice of the bee's honeycomb, we know this density is :math:`d =
\frac{1}{6}\pi\sqrt{3}` (in fact `I learned it
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing>`_ while writing this book).
Considering circles with radius :math:`r`, we can pack at most :math:`\frac{d}{\pi r^2}
= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{6r^2} = \frac{1}{2r^2\sqrt{3}}`. We know the theoretical
upper limit for the number of discs we can pack onto the surface, but we'll
likely not reach this upper limit because of random placements. Furthermore,
because a lot of points will be rejected after a few have been accepted, we
need to set a limit on the number of successive failed trials before we stop
the whole process.


.. code:: python

   import math
   import random

   def DART_sampling(width=1.0, height=1.0, r = 0.025, k=100):
       def distance(p0, p1):

           return math.hypot(dx, dy)

       points = []
       i = 0
       last_success = 0
       while True:
           x = random.uniform(0, width)
           y = random.uniform(0, height)
           accept = True
           for p in points:
               if distance(p, (x, y)) < r:
                   accept = False
                   break
           if accept is True:
               points.append((x, y))
               if i-last_success > k:
                   break
               last_success = i
           i += 1
       return points

I left as an exercise the vectorization of the DART method. The idea is to
pre-compute enough uniform random samples as well as paired distances and to
test for their sequential inclusion.


Bridson method
++++++++++++++

If the vectorization of the previous method poses no real difficulty, the speed
improvement is not so good and the quality remains low and dependent on the `k`
parameter. The higher, the better since it basically governs how hard to try to
insert a new sample. But, when there is already a large number of accepted
samples, only chance allows us to find a position to insert a new sample. We
could increase the `k` value but this would make the method even slower
without any guarantee in quality. It's time to think out-of-the-box and luckily
enough, Robert Bridson did that for us and proposed a simple yet efficient
method:

  **Step 0**. Initialize an n-dimensional background grid for storing samples and
  accelerating spatial searches. We pick the cell size to be bounded by
  :math:`\frac{r}{\sqrt{n}}`, so that each grid cell will contain at most one
  sample, and thus the grid can be implemented as a simple n-dimensional array of
  integers: the default â1 indicates no sample, a non-negative integer gives the
  index of the sample located in a cell.

  **Step 1**. Select the initial sample, :math:`x_0`, randomly chosen uniformly from the
  domain. Insert it into the background grid, and initialize the âactive listâ
  (an array of sample indices) with this index (zero).

  **Step 2**. While the active list is not empty, choose a random index from
  it (say :math:`i`). Generate up to :math:`k` points chosen uniformly from the
  spherical annulus between radius :math:`r` and :math:`2r` around
  :math:`x_i`. For each point in turn, check if it is within distance :math:`r`
  of existing samples (using the background grid to only test nearby
  samples). If a point is adequately far from existing samples, emit it as the
  next sample and add it to the active list. If after :math:`k` attempts no
  such point is found, instead remove :math:`i` from the active list.


Implementation poses no real problem and is left as an exercise for the
reader. Note that not only is this method fast, but it also offers a better
quality (more samples) than the DART method even with a high :math:`k`
parameter.

Conclusion
----------

The last example we've been studying is indeed a nice example where it is more
important to vectorize the problem rather than to vectorize the code (and too
early). In this specific case we were lucky enough to have the work done for us
but it won't be always the case and in such a case, the temptation might be
high to vectorize the first solution we've found. I hope you're now convinced
it might be a good idea in general to look for alternative solutions once
you've found one. You'll (almost) always improve speed by vectorizing your
code, but in the process, you may miss huge improvements.
