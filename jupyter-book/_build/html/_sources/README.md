There are already a fair number of books about NumPy
(see [bibliography](10-bibliography.rst)) and a legitimate question is to
wonder if another book is really necessary. As you may have guessed by reading
these lines, my personal answer is yes, mostly because I think there is room
for a different approach concentrating on the migration from Python to NumPy
through vectorization. There are a lot of techniques that you don't find in
books and such techniques are mostly learned through experience. The goal of
this book is to explain some of these techniques and to provide an opportunity
for making this experience in the process.
